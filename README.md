## Projects

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/ashleyng1/portfolio/blob/main/warren%20doris%20buffett.jpeg"> **[Computational Social Science: Meta Analysis of letters to Warren/ Doris Buffett](https://github.com/ashleyng1/portfolio/tree/main/202307%20buffett%20letters%20project)**

During my internship with [Incite](https://incite.columbia.edu/)@Columbia University, an interdisciplinary research institute, I was part of the Buffett Letters project with Professor Peter Bearman as the Principal Investigator. This project aims to analyze a unique digitized archive of about 10,000 letters written to Warren Buffett and his sister, Doris, between 2006 and 2016 from those around the United States, mostly asking for financial assistance. The letters provide an acute window into both extreme poverty and relative hardship.

I completed 2 main tasks:
1. Used the United States Census Bureau API to tabulate all the relevant variables down to ZIP code (ZTCA5) level from 2000-2016
2. Created various data visualizations showing geographic and temporal variation in letters’ stories through a combination of close reading and computational text analyses.

The objective of this project is to analyze the 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users and predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order. Customer segmentation and affinity analysis are also done to study user purchase patterns.

A hybrid-filtering personalized news articles recommendation system which can suggest articles from popular news service providers based on reading history of twitter users who share similar interests (Collaborative filtering) and content similarity of the article and user’s tweets (Content-based filtering).

In this project I have used models such as RNN, LSTM, 1D-CNN to predict the engine failure 50 cycles ahead of its time, and calculated feature importance from them using sensitivity analysis and shap values. Exponential degradation and similarity-based models are also used to calculate its remaining life.

In this project, I have employed regression techniques to estimate the Power curve of an on-shore Wind turbine. Nonlinear trees based regression methods perform best as true power curve is nonlinear. XGBoost is implemented and optimized using GridSearchCV which yields lowest Test RMSE-6.404.
