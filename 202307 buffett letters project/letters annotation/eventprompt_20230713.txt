"													January 24, 2008
From: [redacted]
P.O. Box [redacted] - Palm Bay FL 32911

Dear Sirs

My name is [redacted] [surname]. I recently received information in the mail regarding different avenues I could take in order to get a loan. I received your name and address along with others. I would like to tell you a little about myself. I am 58 yrs of age. I've been married for 20 yrs. I have 4 children. I have a daughter who's a nurse in the Air Force, a daughter in the Army, a son in the Air Force and a daughter in her junior year at the University in Tampa, Florida. I work (2) jobs.  I average about 98-100 hrs a week. I don't mind that but I'm having a lot of health issues. This has me very worried because if I lose my job I lose everything.

My family means a lot to me. They're my whole life. I don't want to become a burden to them.

That's why I am writing this letter. I owe or should I say that I am about $60,000 in debt. I would some how like to get this paid off. 

In the 20 yrs I've been married I don't think my wife and I have been one week just the two of us. I'm not asking for a handout.

I just don't want to have to worry about my wife if something happens to me. I struggle with severe back problems, I can't control my blood pressure. I just want a fresh start.

I don't know if this letter will do any good. But if there's anyway you or your organization can help then I ask you to please help me. I'm at a dead-end and don't know where else to turn. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[redacted]

Warren Buffett
Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
3555 Farnam Street, Suite 1400 Omaha NE 68131

Dear Mr. Buffett,

My name is [redacted] and I am the eldest of four siblings and unfortunately that also comes along with so many responsibilities which helped me to be able to mature very quickly. Recently, I succeeded in being the first in my family to graduate from high school; however, now I hope to also become a first generation college student, and eventually, college graduate. Throughout this last school year I have proudly accomplished over one hundred hours of community service—including volunteering for the red cross, local train museum, a youth wrestling program and other great organizations while maintaining good academic standing. Because of my determination and hard work through high school, I was very fortunate to be accepted into Washington State University which has always been my dream school. However, being accepted is only the first step for me. I am faced with overwhelming obstacles that follow me like a shadow. No matter how hard I try I cannot shake off the obstacles that seem to haunt me. I am what is considered a 1079 student or in other words, I am undocumented illegal immigrant. As a child, I was proud to have been born in Mexico. I was always aware of my roots and where I was born but I was too innocent minded to know that I was at a disadvantage. When I was old enough to understand, my parents explained to me they had migrated from Mexico in order to provide a better life style not only for themselves but to put their children in a land of better opportunities in hopes that we too could have a better future. I had yet to understand that being an illegal immigrant would impact my life directly throughout its course. Growing up I always reached for the stars—working hard in school and attempting to receive the best grades I could; I had to be extra good at everything I did just so I could feel that I fit in with everyone else. As you probably already know, I don’t qualify for any grants offered to U.S. citizens and scholarships offered to 1079 students are very slim. I now have to find a way to cover my college expenses, including: tuition and fees, room and board, books, as well as transportation—which will approximately add to $28,000 this first year. Although my parents make about $ 36,000 a year, maintaining a house hold of four Hispanic children isn’t in any way easy. I witnessed them waking up at five in the morning every day to work long and scrunching hours in the sun in order to maintain our growing family. Throughout middle school and high school I kept the mentality of striving for the best so that one day my parents would no longer have to work painful hours picking fruit for the minimum wage. This mindset helped me ignore the all constant teasing from classmates once they found out I was an illegal student. Although I was tagged as the “wet back” and “dirty Mexican” from my classmates, it never stopped me from working towards my goal to become successful and making my parents proud. In high school I participated in three sports cross country, wrestling, and tennis. I also participated in clubs including Youth Alive and National Honors Society. I graduated this past May with both an honor cord for excellent academics and a Washington State High School Proficient Exam Cord. During my graduation ceremony I was extremely honored to receive the [redacted] High School service pin for all the service I contributed to my school and community. Throughout the ceremony I would look over at my parents just to see how proud they were of all my accomplishments—my journey of transforming my dreams into a reality had just begun. As this chapter of my life came to an end it was time to begin a new one; Post-secondary education. Unfortunately because of my legal status I cannot apply for many scholarships as well as financial aid. However, I was lucky enough to have the amazing opportunity to apply and receive the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals— granting me a social security number and workers permit that can be used exclusively for job employment opportunities. In terms of financing for college, I have been working non-stop at various jobs, such as yard work, babysitting, and sorting potatoes at a local factory; giving me the opportunity to raise approximately $3,000. This is nowhere near the amount I need to reach my goal of $28,000 needed to cover my first year at the Washington State University. For that reason I have searched high and low in hopes that I could find a scholarship somewhere. A brave little voice inside me said to write to you and ask for a scholarship. At first I thought it was way out of line to write and ask you for help, but then again....why not? Someone once said that successful people are risk takers and that this world belongs to those who take those risks. Some laughed at my idea to write to you, but that just gave me all the more reason to write to you. If you find it in your heart to help me with a scholarship of any amount, In return, I will pledge to strive for the best grades. Continue to serve my community and ultimately become a productive member of society—one who will oblige the laws and serve those around me. Although I am aware my legal situation does not give me the same benefits my peers may have, it definitely motivates me to strive to be the best in all aspects of my life. I plan to focus all my effort into completing college with a major in communications. I hope that you will be able to assist me in financing my future. As well as helping me realize my dreams and make my family proud. Thank you so much for your time.

Sincerely,
[redacted]
