 Sunshine Ladies
  Foundation - Not just
  A 'dribble':","With so many worthy causes, big and small, how does she pick?
 Many times, Buffett leaves it to her ""Sunbeams"" -- a loose network of friends and acquaintances across the country who act as
  ""junior philanthropists."" They pinpoint a person in need and send Buffett a one-page letter detailing the problem. If they've done their 
 homework, and the facts check out, Buffett puts a check in the mail the next day.
 Then there are her scholarships. Some go to youth who have ambition but lack means -- as long as they do not smoke, drink,
  do drugs or pierce anything except their ears. Others go to abused women nominated by shelters. Their scholarships can cover doctor visits and rent 
 deposits, as well as tuition and books.
 And sometimes Buffett simply stumbles upon something that inspires -- or annoys -- her.
 Annoyance prompted her to open her pocketbook and write a $61,000 check to the Fredericksburg City Council. The city was about to open its first public pool when residents 
 complained that the entry fee was prohibitive for some of the city's kids. A few strokes of Buffett's pen solved the problem, allowing all residents to enter for free this summer.
 A road separates the pool from a community with many kids who live in poverty, she said. ""I can't bear to think of the kids on one side of the road hearing the kids on the other side 
 of the road splashing around and having fun.""
 Buffett inherited some of her money when her mother died in 1996, she said. Then there's the stock she has in her brother's company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ""He makes the money, 
 and I spend it,"" Buffett said. ""It's the perfect deal.""
 When her foundation needs it, she'll cash in a share or two.
 ""I'm not trying to manage the money,"" Buffett said. ""I'm not trying to leave it to my children. I'm not looking for tax benefits. I'm not trying to earn brownie points to get to heaven. 
 I just think it's the right thing to do, and it gives me enormous joy to do it because life is really, really hard, in case you haven't noticed that.""",Link,,"abuse, scholarships","abuse, scholarship"

 Warren Buffett doesn't

 might try his sister Doris. 
 Sally Beatty on the 
 charity and frugality 
 that run in the family.","One day last July, UPS delivered a large cardboard box to the doorstep of a condominium in Rockport, Maine. Inside were more than 1,400 letters.
 A New York state man wrote that he couldn't afford a new glass eye. A woman from New Jersey talked about the strain of caring for a sister suffering from multiple sclerosis.
  A Florida woman described her efforts to regain custody of her three small children. The letters, which came from all over the world, had two things in common: All of them 
 were pleas for money. And all were addressed to billionaire investor Warren Buffett.
 Buffett, who lives in Omaha, Neb., had forwarded them to someone he knew he could trust to give them a fair hearing -- his 79-year-old sister, Doris.
 Last summer, after Buffett pledged shares now worth over $35 billion to the charity of his good friend Bill Gates, the pleas began pouring in. 
 Since the Bill & Melinda Gates 
 Foundation, which focuses on global health and education, doesn't give money to individuals, Buffett began putting the letters aside for Doris, who runs a small foundation 
 of her own. And to the great surprise of the people who'd written, Buffett began calling them.
 
 Marie Delahoussaye, a widow in Texas, asked for money to replace an obsolete hearing aid that ""whistles."" In neat, black cursive script on green-lined memo paper she 
 wrote, ""Please consider helping me. I live very frugally. I don't waste anything.""
 Doris Buffett paid for two hearing aids that cost about $1,800 total. Delahoussaye -- who says she never expected to receive a response -- says the devices have helped 
 her reconnect with friends and her community. Before getting the hearing aids, ""I couldn't hear the phone ring,"" she says. ""I would go to church and couldn't hear the 
 sermon."" She says the experience has reaffirmed her faith in strangers. ""This has made me realize there are still good people in the world,"" she says.
 Warren Buffett says his sister ""is far more philanthropic than I am. She identifies with the underdog. I do it in a wholesale way, but not on a one-on-one basis. She really 
 wants to know their stories.""
 Doris Buffett has at least one thing in common with her famously thrifty brother, who prefers hamburgers to five-star fare and lives in the same house he bought decades
  ago: Buffett was raised during the Depression, and even when being generous she's extremely frugal. Her gifts to the letter writers have averaged about $4,800 each.
 Some supplicants get stern advice along with their check. She suggested that one grandmother who was having trouble making ends meet make extra money by baby sitting. 
 She told an older couple whose children had moved out to consider taking in a border. She sends many letter writers to local credit-counseling groups.
 Doris Buffett's crew of part-time helpers negotiates directly with the letter writers' lenders to settle debts for less money. They buy used cars rather than new ones for people 
 who have no other means of getting to work. And they insist that letter writers shop around for the lowest possible car insurance rates, including getting a quote from Geico, 
 which is owned by her brother's company, Berkshire Hathaway.
 The applicants who get money never receive enough to solve all their financial needs. Mitty Ewing, a onetime banker, has helped Doris Buffett run her philanthropy, called the 
 Sunshine Lady Foundation, since 1998. She says Doris Buffett's goal is ""to figure out what is the greatest need and how can we satisfy it with the fewest dollars.""
 ""I don't want to become their mommy. I don't think that's healthy. We're supposed to empower, but not enable. It's a fine line and I think it makes them more responsible in the 
 end."" Moreover, she says, being careful with money ""means we can help more people.""
 While her brother is the country's second-richest person, Doris Buffett hasn't always had wealth herself. ""I did have times in my life when I had to count the pennies,"" including 
 when her three children were very young, she says. ""I'd never experienced real wealth until after my mother died"" in 1996, she says. That's when she inherited money from a 
 family trust. And although she has battled cancer twice, she doesn't go soft when helping others with their health issues.
 Karen Yarbrough, a 33-year-old single mother of three, works as a cook and can't afford health insurance. Her 12-year-old daughter Lauren was infected by a rare fungal 
 disease, leaving her blind in one eye, and she underwent more than 30 operations. Medicare covered close to $10 million in hospital bills, but Yarbrough, who lives in 
 Millington, Tenn., near Memphis, still owed over $300,000. Yarbrough's twin sister, Sharon Pacheco, wrote to Warren Buffett on her behalf: ""My sister Karen is trying 
 to work when she can to keep from losing her house and car. I am not able to help her financially because I can barely make ends meet. So, this is where I want to ask for 
 your help.""
 After exchanging phone calls and letters, and verifying the women's story by reviewing tax filings and medical bills, Doris Buffett's foundation wrote checks to Yarbrough's
  lenders for more than $8,000. That gave her breathing room. ""If she hadn't helped me, I would have lost my house and everything,"" Yarbrough says.
 Warren Buffett, 76, traces his older sister's charitable impulse to their father. ""That was part of his ethos,"" he says of Howard Buffett, a stockbroker who became a 
 congressman. The money that she gives away comes mainly from a trust established by their father -- which Warren Buffett says he increased from under $100,000 
 to ""maybe $300 million"" by investing in the phenomenally profitable stock of Berkshire Hathaway. The funds eventually went to Doris Buffett and her sister, Bertie. 
 Doris Buffett, who has been married four times and currently is single, has three children in their 50s. She declines to disclose her net worth or how much of the 
 trust money she received.
 Doris Buffett estimates that her foundation has received more than 3,000 letters from her brother's office, and they keep coming. So far, she has given away more 
 than $1.4 million to more than 300 letter writers. Another 100 or so writers have been asked to provide documentation. To cover the cost of aiding the letter writers,
  last September Buffett transferred $5 million in Berkshire Hathaway stock to his sister's foundation. Otherwise, Buffett isn't involved in his sister's philanthropy.",Article,"MS/multiple schlerosis, custody, used car, hearing aid, no health insurance",,"vehicle, sclerosis"

 That means organizing a network of more than 150 ""Sunbeams"" across the country who are allotted up to $10,000 a year to help the less fortunate.
 
 It means paying college tuition for Afghan women, giving scholarships to battered and sexually abused women, educating prisoners, helping the mentally ill, building

 Interesting Life of Doris Buffett","CHARLIE ROSE: Who do you give this money to?
 
 DORIS BUFFETT: We put out the message when I was in Denver at a convention of battered-wives, people. And that was a huge success. It was a really a huge morale boost for those women.
 
 And then one of the women that was promoted -- what we say, by somebody else in her safe house, she said ""You really should know what a wonderful girl Gale Healy is and how she goes above and beyond what a director has to do."" They said, ""For instance, there is a woman who came in here with three children and she had never finished high school,"" and Gale said, ""You have the ability, so let`s get you a GED,"" which she did, and then got her to go on to college. When this proposal was written to me this woman was getting a Ph.D., and I thought, ""Well,"" a light went on, I said, ""there must be hundreds out there, and certainly education would make all the difference for them."" So we started the women`s independence scholarship program, WISP, women and we have had 1,500 and more -- 1,500 who have graduated and have gone on to wonderful lives.
 
 CHARLIE ROSE: Tell me what interests you.
 
 DORIS BUFFETT: One of my biggest interests right now, and has been for six years, is educating prisoners. And last week, Warren went with me to the Sing-Sing graduation.
 
 Here is the interesting fact -- 400,000 people get out of prison every year in this country. I`m trying to remember how many there are in prison. I can`t because I can never remember numbers but as we all know it`s a lot -- way too many. And normally, everywhere else from coast to coast the recidivism with rate within a year or two hovers between 60 and 63 percent. Now, of the graduates of Mercy College who got their degree while they were in prison at Sing-Sing, there have been 41 who have gone through the process and been released, their recidivism rate is -- guess what.
 
 CHARLIE ROSE: Zero.
 
 DORIS BUFFETT: You`re right. You could have been a little -- you could have given me a -- well, anyhow, it is zero. And that`s thrilling, and that`s one of the biggest problems we have in the country, because 60 to 70 percent -- how many did I say, 400,000 to 600,000 get out every year. They`re going to come out. Do you want them to go back to their old way of life or would you like to see them paying taxes?
 
 CHARLIE ROSE: We would like to see them paying taxes.
 
 What was the hardest story to tell?
 
 DORIS BUFFETT: I think to admit about the marriages and the fact I don`t have the best relationships with my children. I do have some wonderful relationships with a couple of my grandsons, and that`s --

 The Doris Buffett Story","Warren Buffett's big sister Doris has never lost that quality, despite personal problems that would have soured others on the world. The ""retail"" philanthropist known as the Sunshine Lady d
 erives such joy from helping others on a one on one basis that emotional abuse by a mother who may have been bipolar, a string of horrific marriages, nearly losing her home after the 1987 
 stock market crash, two bouts of cancer, and, worst of all, estrangement from her own children, have never hardened her heart.
 
 Instead, her own problems have caused empathy for others, evident since childhood, to deepen over the years. She has donated $100 million of her own money, mostly to individuals in trouble 
 through no fault of their own, often taking the time to call them personally to determine the best way to help. At 82, her goal is to give away her entire fortune, which remains substantial despite
  her generosity and the stock market crash of 2008.
